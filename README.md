This script will attempt to teleport you to safety using seed pod/tab in 28th inventory slot after activating F1 hotkey to open your backpack.
This script works by monitoring your health orb and activates at approximately 50 health and anything lower. 
There is a 25 second cool down on the automated emergency teleport.
Alternatively you can use Numpad 0 to activate the same script regardless of Health points.
This option has a no cooldown.
You can close this script at anytime by pressing Numpad 9.
You can pause this script at anytime by pressing F12.
